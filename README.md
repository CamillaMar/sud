# SUD üßôüèΩ

Hi! This is a Java based project I created about one month and a half into my process of learning this programming language.

SUD is for Single User Dungeon, so it gives you the opportunity to create a player and wander around a few rooms, interacting with some NPCs and fighting magical creatures (it's fantasy themed, you might recognize a few names!).

It reads console's inputs, so it's possible to play on your favourite IDEs (or at least most of them).

Hope you have fun, and for any advice or comment, do not esitate to contact me!

Camilla
